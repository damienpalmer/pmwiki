This is pmwikiserv -- a lightweight HTTP-server for standalone installations
of PmWiki.  It allows PmWiki to be run without a webserver; or, more
precisely, it provides a barebones "server" that can run PmWiki
in absence of another server.  In fact, it only understands four
url paths:
    /wiki    - retrieve a PmWiki page
    /pub     - retrieve a file from the PmWiki pub/ directory
    /uploads - retrieve a file from the PmWiki uploads/ directory
    /phpinfo - return information about the PHP environment
Any other request results in a "404 Not Found" error.

Installing standalone under Microsoft Windows
---------------------------------------------
1.  If you don't have one already, install a version of PmWiki
2.  Copy the "server/" directory containing these files into
    the PmWiki main directory.
3.  Execute the "pmwikiserv.bat" file in the server directory.
4.  Open a browser to "http://localhost/wiki" to start using the
    wiki.

Installing standalone under Unix-based systems
----------------------------------------------
By default this server wants to listen on port 80, but opening
ports below 1024 on Unix systems requires superuser (root) privileges.
Since we really don't recommend running this server as root, 
you'll want to customize the $Listen variable in pmwikiserv.php
to a port number above 1024.  8000 is a common choice.

Once you have done that, the server can be started by entering
the command "php pmwikiserv.php".  Then you can open a browser
to "http://your.server.address:port/wiki" to start accessing
PmWiki.
