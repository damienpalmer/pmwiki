CIS-Dept. Lean Skin for PmWiki 2
================================
INSTALL.txt

This skin installs in two easy steps:  Put the files in the correct
location, then configure PmWiki to use the skin by adding some lines
to the local configuration file.

Step 1 - Copy Files
-------------------
Copy the lean/ directory to your wiki's pub/skins/ directory.
The directory contains the following files:

pub/skins/lean/
|-- README.txt        Brief documentation
|-- INSTALL.txt       This file
|-- lean.tmpl         Template
|-- lean.php          PHP script
|-- lean.css          CSS stylesheet
|-- leanicon.gif      Icon image
|-- leanlogo.gif      Logo graphic image
|-- print/
|   `-- print.tmpl    Print View template
`-- wikilib.d/
    |-- Site.LeanEditForm   Custom edit form
    `-- Site.LeanXLPage     Preferences page

Step 2 - Edit local configuration file
--------------------------------------
The following lines go in your local/config.php local configuration
file.

## Use the CIS-Dept. Lean Skin.
$Skin = 'lean';

If you don't have a local/config.php yet you'll need to create one.
Make sure that "<?php" is the very first line, with no leading spaces.
You don't need a closing "?>". Here's an example local/config.php:

<?php
# Title of this wiki
$WikiTitle = 'Wiki Site';

# Use the CIS-Dept. Lean Skin.
$Skin = 'lean';

You can also use the bundled printable-view skin by adding another
line:

$ActionSkin['print'] = 'lean/print';


Translation
-----------

Some translation hints (inspired by a suggestion from Isidor
http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Profiles/Isidor).
* Be sure to translate the tool tips.
* Check the lean.php file for items that need translation.
* Maybe try this command (from the skin's directory):  grep '\$\[' *


Other Steps - Customize (optional)
----------------------------------

Logo or Text Home Page Link -
You can either use the logo provided or use a text link instead.  Edit
lean.tmpl template and rearrange some comment lines ("<!--" and "-->")
to switch.  If you want to replace the provided logo with your own, place
your image file in the skin's directory and edit lean.php and place your
logo image's name where you see the name of the stock logo (leanlogo.gif).
It's in there two places.

Custom Style Settings -
You can customize the appearance of this skin by editing the lean.css file.
Remember to view your pages in different browsers (at least a Mozilla browser
and IE) to assure cross-browser compatibility.

Inconspicuous Wiki Links -
This version of the skin comes with the wiki links prominently shown at
the top and bottom.  Uncomment the appropriate lines in the lean.css file
to make the wiki-ness a little more subtle.

Stealthy Wiki Links -
As with the previous version of this skin, you can enable Stealthy Wiki
Links by removing the appropriate comments in the lean.css file.

Invisible Wiki Links -
You can also try enabling the new Invisible Wiki Links by removing the
comment lines near the end of the lean.css file.  This way wiki links aren't
displayed but their access keys still work in Firefox (but not Internet
Explorer).  This allows you to have a site that looks like an ordinary site,
but is a quick and easy-to-edit wiki.
